# Data
This study uses data from the 2022 General Social Survey (GSS).  The total sample size for the 2022 GSS is approximately 4,194 respondents, 1,178 of whom provided valid responses for the variables included in the model. The discrepancy in sample size results from deleting cases with missing data on key variables, ensuring that the final model is based on complete data. The cleaned dataset allows for a focused examination of how religious affiliation, gender, race, political party affiliation, and age affect educational attainment perceptions in the United States.
# Operationalization
This section outlines the conceptualization and operationalization of the dependent and independent variables. The variables were selected based on their theoretical relevance to research questions and were recoded where necessary to enhance interpretability and model fit. The dependent variable in this study is perceived inequality in educational attainment, potentially based on structural or societal factors. It is operationalized using a GSS survey item that directly asks if the respondent perceives educational disparities. The variable is recoded into a binary format, where “1” indicates the respondent believes there are educational attainment inequalities and “0” indicates they do not. This perception-based variable captures personal and broader group-based experiences and interpretations of educational fairness. The independent variables are grouped into social/demographic and institutional categories. 

Social Position
First, race is conceptualized as the respondent's racial identity, reflecting a key social position of stratification in the United States. This variable is included in the model to account for the impact of structural racism and historical inequities on access to education and perceived inequalities. It is operationalized using the GSS race variable (RACECEN1), which captures self-reported racial identification. For analytical clarity and statistical power, the original categories were recoded into three groups: White, Black, and Other, with White as the reference category. This grouping allows for clearer comparisons while acknowledging that race continues to shape educational opportunity and outcomes through systemic disadvantage and social exclusion.

Gender is another key demographic, representing self-identified gender using the GSS variable SEX. It is coded as 1 = Man and 2 = Woman, with the variable used as-is due to its binary structure in the GSS dataset. Gender is included to account for how gender roles and experiences shape educational and career expectations.

Age is included as a continuous variable and used to define generational groups, recognizing that different generations may have had distinct educational experiences. Using respondents’ reported age, generational categories were created: Gen Z (<26), Millennials (26–41), Gen X (42–57), Baby Boomers (58–76), and Silent Generation (77+). The model includes these categories as binary dummy variables to facilitate comparisons across generational experiences. 

Income is used to measure economic status and is operationalized using the respondent’s reported income in dollars. It is treated as a continuous variable and mean-centered to improve interpretability and reduce multicollinearity. Based on its well-established relationship with educational access, opportunity, and social stratification, income is included. 

Institutional Affiliations 
Religious affiliation is included as a measure of spiritual identity and its potential influence on worldviews related to education and inequality. This is based on the respondent’s self-reported religious preference in the GSS and recoded into five categories: Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Other, and None, with Protestant as the reference group. Categories were condensed to ensure sufficient sample sizes for statistical comparison.

Finally, political views represent political ideology and institutional trust, which may influence respondents’ views on fairness and equity in education. They are derived from the GSS party ID variable and recoded into three categories, Liberal, Moderate, and Conservative, based on ideological leaning, with Conservatives as the reference group. This simplification allows for clearer comparisons while capturing the impact of political worldviews on perceptions of systemic inequality.
